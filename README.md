# MCap-Comparator

MCap Comparator is a project made only with html/css and js.
It works by fetching data from the Coingecko and Alpha Vantage API therefore, both crypto and US stocks are acceptable.

MCap Comparator works by calculating the hypothetical price of an asset if it had the market capitalization of another asset.
Asset1 is the asset with the price to be changed and Asset 2 is the asset with the market cap to be compared.
